Due: Tuesday, Novemeber 18th 2025

### Introduction to While Loops

Navigate to https://www.edube.org, sign in, access Python Essentials 1, and read **Python Essentials 1 Module 3, 3.2.1.1  - 3.2.1.3**

### While Loop Lab
Complete lab 3.2.1.3 and upload it to your assignments folder / filename: `LastNameFirstInitial_Lab_3_2_1_3_Guess_the_Secret_Number.py`

### While Loop Exercises

In your notes, code trace each of the code snippets below to determine what the code will output.  If executing the code will result in an error, explain why:

a. 
```python
a = 0
while < 10:
  print(a, end= '')
  a += 2
```

b. 
```python
b = 0
print('Here we go', end = '')
while b >= 0:
  print('o')
  b += 1
```

b. Assume the user inputs `2` and `3` respectively:
```python
num_1 = input()
num_1 = int(num_1)
num_2 = input()
num_2 = int(num_2)
print(num_1 + num_2)
```



Scan your work, save it as `LastNameFirstInitial_While_Loop_Code_Tracing_Practice.pdf`, and upload it to your assignments folder.<br>

Commit your progress.  Remember to write an appropriate commit message.  For example, *"Completed input code tracing practice."*
