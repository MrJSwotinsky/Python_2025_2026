### `break`, `continue`, and a New Application of `else`

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>DO NOW:</b><br><br>
    What do you think of when you hear the word, 'break'?.<br>
    What do you think of when you hear the word, 'continue'?<br>
    In coding, where have you previously seen `else`?  How has it been used?<br><br>
    <b>Be prepared to share your responses.</b></td></td>

**AIM:** How can we leverage `break`, `continue`, and `else` to control the flow of our programs?

**ANCHOR SKILL(S) AND POWER STANDARD(S):** 

 - [ ] <ins>TYS63T.3</ins>: Apply computational thinking to a variety of tasks.
 - [ ] <ins>TYS63T.4</ins>: Code using appropriate logic and syntax.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- [ ] I can apply code tracing strategies to determine the result of executing code that involves `break`, `continue`, and `else` in while loops and for loops.

**AGENDA:**

1. Break and Continue
2. Introducting a New Application of Else
3. Interactive Live Coding
4. Code Tracing
5. Check for Understanding
6. Homework Head Start
