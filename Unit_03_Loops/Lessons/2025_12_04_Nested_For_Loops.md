### Nested for Loops

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>DO NOW:</b><br><br>
    In your own words, describe the similarities and differences between `while` loops and `for` loops.<br><br>
    <b>Be prepared to share your responses.</b></td></td>
  </tr>
</table>

**AIM:** How can we leverage nested `for` loops to control the flow of our programs?

**ANCHOR SKILL(S) AND POWER STANDARD(S):** 

 - [ ] <ins>TYS63T.3</ins>: Apply computational thinking to a variety of tasks.
 - [ ] <ins>TYS63T.4</ins>: Code using appropriate logic and syntax.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- [ ] I can apply code tracing strategies to determine the result of executing code that involves nested `for` loops.

**AGENDA:**

1. Comparing `while` Loops and `for` Loops
2. Revisiting the Structure of `for` Loops 
3. Introduction to Nested `for` Loops
4. Code Tracing with Nested `for` Loops
5. Check for Understanding
6. Homework Head Start

**HOMEWORK:**
