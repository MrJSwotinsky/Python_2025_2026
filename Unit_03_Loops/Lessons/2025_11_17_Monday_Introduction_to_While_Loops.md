### Introduction to While Loops

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>DO NOW:</b><br><br>
    You are training a robot to empty a cookie jar one cookie at a time...<br><br>
    <b>Without using code</b>, write a simple algorithm the robot could follow to empty the cookie jar, one cookie at a time, and stop when the jar is empty.<br><br>
    <b>Be prepared to share your responses.</b></td></td>
  </tr>

**AIM:** How can we leverage while loops to control the flow of our programs?

**ANCHOR SKILL(S) AND POWER STANDARD(S):** 

 - [ ] <ins>TYS63T.3</ins>: Apply computational thinking to a variety of tasks.
 - [ ] <ins>TYS63T.4</ins>: Code using appropriate logic and syntax.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- [ ] I can apply code tracing strategies to determine the result of executing code that involves while loops.
