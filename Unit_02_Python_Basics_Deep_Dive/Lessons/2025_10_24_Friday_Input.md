### Input

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>DO NOW:</b><br><br>
    In your own words, describe what the words 'input' and 'output' make you think of.<br><br>
    <b>Be prepared to share your responses.</b></td></td>
  </tr>
</table>

**AIM:** How can we leverage input and output to make our programs interactive?

**ANCHOR SKILL(S) AND POWER STANDARD(S):** 

- [ ] <ins>TYS63T.4</ins>: Code using appropriate logic and syntax.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- [ ] I can write code that accepts input from the user, converts it (if neccesary), assigns it to a variable, and uses it later in a program.
- [ ] I can apply code tracing strategies to analyze code that involves input/output and determine the expected result of executing the code.

**AGENDA:**

1. Exploring the Ideas of Input and Output
2. The `input()` Function and Variables
3. A Quick Review of Type Casting and Operators
4. Does `input()` Always Require Output?
5. Analyzing Code That Involves `input()`
6. Check for Understanding

**HOMEWORK:**
