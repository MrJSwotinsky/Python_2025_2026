### Shortcut Operators, Comments, and Subgoal Labels

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>DO NOW:</b><br><br>
    1. Assume `5` has been assigned to the variable, `n`.  Write a line of code to increase the value of `n` by `1`.<br>
    2. Assume an unknown int has been assigned to the variable, `m`.  Write a line of code to increase the value of `m` by `1`.<br>
    3. Describe how each line of code you wrote will work.<br><br>
    <b>Be prepared to share your responses.</b></td></td>

**AIM:** How can we leverage variables to store data?

**ANCHOR SKILL(S) AND POWER STANDARD(S):** 

- [ ] <ins>TYS63T.4</ins>: Code using appropriate logic and syntax.
- [ ] <ins>TYS63T.9</ins>: Communicate effectively as a computer scientist.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- [ ] I can use shortcut operators to increment and decrement variables.
- [ ] I can extend the use of shortcut operators to other operations.
- [ ] I can leverage comments to improve the readability of my code.
- [ ] I can can leverage subgoal labels to plan my code.

**AGENDA:**

1. Shortcut Operators
2. Comments
3. Subgoal Labels
4. Calculator Task Work Time

**HOMEWORK:**
