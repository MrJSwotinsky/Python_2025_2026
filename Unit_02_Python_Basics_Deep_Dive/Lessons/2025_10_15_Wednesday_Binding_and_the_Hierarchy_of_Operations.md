**AIM:** In what ways does Python prioritize operations?

**ANCHOR SKILL(S) AND POWER STANDARD(S):** 

 - [ ] <ins>TYS63T.3</ins>: Apply computational thinking to a variety of tasks.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- [ ] I can determine the output of an expression containing numerical data types and the operations `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `**`, and `%`.

**AGENDA:**

1. Recalling the Order of Operations
2. Python's Hierarchy of Operations
3. Binding
4. Check for Understanding

**HOMEWORK:** 

[Python - Unit 2, Assignment 6 - Binding and the Hierarchy of Operations](https://github.com/MrJSwotinsky/Python_2025_2026/blob/main/Unit_02_Python_Basics_Deep_Dive/Assignments/Assignment_06_Binding_and_the_Heirarchy_of_Operations.md)
