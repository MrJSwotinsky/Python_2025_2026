      <b>DO NOW:</b><br><br>
      Reflect on your progress in Python so far...
      <ul>
        <li>What, if anything do you need to catch up on?</li>
        <li>In what ways might you be able to cruise forward?</li>
      </ul>
      Write down one specific and achievable goal for today...
      <ul>
        <li>Will you catch up by working on something that you have not yet completed?  If so, what specifically will you spend the period working on?</li>
        <li>Will you cruise forward by working on something new to extend your learning? If so, what specifically will you spend the period working on?</li>
      </ul>
   <b>Be prepared to share your responses.</b>
