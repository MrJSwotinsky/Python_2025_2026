### Unit 2, Checkpoint 1 - The `print()` Function

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Today is a checkpoint...Prepare to show what you know!</b><br><br>
    <b>DO NOW:</b><br><br>
    1. Find a seat with some space between you and the person next to you.<br>
    2. Take out a pen or pencil.<br>
    3. Place all other items under your table.<br><br>
    <b>The checkpoint will begin when everyone is ready.</b></td>
  </tr>
</table>

**REMINDERS:** 

* Read all prompts carefully.
* Respond to all prompts thoughtfully and completely.
* Do your best.
* Checkpoints are independent assessments - Save collaboration and communication with others for a different time.
