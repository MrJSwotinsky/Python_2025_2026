    7. What do you notice?<br><br>
    8. Try to print `'Hello, World!'` including the quotation marks again, this time by replacing your code with the following code.<br>
    <pre><code>print("'Hello, World!'")</code></pre>
    9. What do you notice?<br><br>
    10. Finally, try to print `'Hello, World!'` including the quotation marks one more time, this time by replacing your code with the following code.<br>

**AIM:** What are escape characters, the `sep` parameter, and the `end` parameter, and how can we leverage them to display what we intend to display?

**ANCHOR SKILL(S) AND POWER STANDARD(S):** 

 - [ ] <ins>TYS63T.4</ins>: Code using appropriate logic and syntax.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- [ ] I can describe what functions are, what they can accomplish, and the syntax required to call functions.
- [ ] I can describe what specifically the `print()` function does, and the syntax required to call the `print()` function.
- [ ] I can describe what strings are and how strings are denoted.
- [ ] I can apply the `print()` function to display information to the user.

**AGENDA:**

1. Exploring `print()`
2. The `print()` Function.
     * Single-Line Display
     * Multi-Line Display
     * Vertical Whitespace
3. Strings
4. Python Functions in General
     * Result vs. Effect
     * Name and Argument(s)
     * Syntax
     * Built-in Functions vs. User-defined Functions
5. Check for Understanding
