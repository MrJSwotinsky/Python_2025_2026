**AIM:** What are escape characters, the `sep` parameter, and the `end` parameter, and how can we leverage them to display what we intend to display?

**ANCHOR SKILL(S) AND POWER STANDARD(S):** 

 - [ ] <ins>TYS63T.4</ins>: Code using appropriate logic and syntax.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- [ ] I can describe what escape characters are, and how they are used.
- [ ] I can leverage escape characters to include tabs, newlines, backlashes, quotes, etc. in strings.
- [ ] I can describe what the `sep` and `end` parameters are and how they are used.
- [ ] I can leverage the `sep` and `end` characters to customize the way output is displayed.

**AGENDA:**

1. Exploring `/`, `sep`, and `end`
2. A Quick Note About Built-In vs. User-Defined Functions     
3. Escape Characters
     * `/t`
     * `/n`
     * `/'`
     * `/"`
     * `//`
4. Displaying Quotes (An Alternative to Escape Characters)
5. Additional `print()` parameters
     * `sep`
     * `end`
6. Check for Understanding
