### Variables

    <td><b>DO NOW:</b><br><br>
    Think back to your study of math...<br><br>
    What do you recall about variables?<br><br>
    <b>Be prepared to share your responses.</b></td></td>

**AIM:** How can we leverage variables to store data?

**ANCHOR SKILL(S) AND POWER STANDARD(S):** 

- [ ] <ins>TYS63T.1</ins>: Describe the characteristics of Python as a programming language.
- [ ] <ins>TYS63T.3</ins>: Apply computational thinking to a variety of tasks.
- [ ] <ins>TYS63T.4</ins>: Code using appropriate logic and syntax.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- [ ] I can desribe what variables are and how they are used to store data.
- [ ] I can describe the requirements for a variable name to be legal in Python, and classify variable names as legal or not legal.
- [ ] I can apply code tracing strategies to analyze code snippets that involve variables and assignment.

**AGENDA:**

1. Recalling Variables from Math
2. The Box Model of Python Variables
3. Variable Name Requirements
4. What Would PEP - 8 Say?
5. Applying Code Tracing Strategies to Analyze Code Snippets
6. Check for Understanding

**HOMEWORK:**
