### Data Types

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>DO NOW:</b><br><br>
      What do you think of when you hear the words 'literal' and 'literally'?<br><br>
    <b>Be prepared to share your responses</b></td>
  </tr>
</table>

**AIM:** What are ints, floats, strings, and booleans and in what ways can they be represented?

**ANCHOR SKILL(S) AND POWER STANDARD(S):** 

 - [ ] <ins>TYS63T.3</ins>: Apply computational thinking to a variety of tasks.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- [ ] I can describe and provide examples of ints, floats, strings, and booleans.
- [ ] I can represent ints, floats, strings, and booleans in a variety of different ways.
- [ ] I can display the data type of a given literal.
- [ ] I can type cast literals.
- [ ] I understand that different data types are stored differently in memory.

**AGENDA:**

1. Literally Reviewing the Do Now
2. Ints
     * Positive Ints...and 0
     * Negative Ints
     * Large Ints
3. Floats
    * 1.0 versus 1. vs 1
    * Scientific Notation
4. Strings
    * Characters
    * Strings
    * 'One' versus '1' versus 1
5.  Booleans
    * True
    * False
    * True versus 'True' versus true and False versus 'False' versus false
    * True Statements
    * False Statements
    * Numerical Equivalents
    * Is 1 "the same" as 1.0?      
6. Binary, Octal, and Hexadecimal (DigiKey [Number System Conversion Calculator](https://www.digikey.com/en/resources/conversion-calculators/conversion-calculator-number-conversion))
7. The `type()` Function
8. Type Casting
9. Check for Understanding
