## Unit 2, Assignment 5 - Calculator Task First Prototype
Due: Tuesday, October 14th 2025

### Calculator Task First Prototype:
1. In the Python IDLE, create a file titled `LastNameFirstInitial_Calculator_Task_Code.py`
2. Write some initial code to begin creating the first prototype of your calculator.

   For this iteration of your code, focus on designing a welcome screen.  Apply what you have learned about the `print()` function, including escape characters, the `sep` parameter, the `end` parameter, and ASCII art as you work to create a visually appealing welcome screen that greets the user.  **Remember to keep your audience in mind.**
   
3. Save your file.
4. Capture a screencast **(in .mp4 format)** of your code in action.

    At this stage, this should be a **very short (i.e. a couple of senconds long)** video of the console displaying the welcome screen.

5. Save your video as `LastNameFirstInitial_Calculator_Task_Video.mp4`
6. Upload your code and video files to your Calculator Task folder.
7. Commit your progress.
    * Remember to write a short and simple commit message to describe your progress.
    * Remember to write a more detailed commit description to describe your progress and next steps.
  
*Feel free to continue working on your calculator!*

**Whenever you make significant progress (or if you haven't commited in a while) remember to save your code, capture a screencast, upload, and commit!**
