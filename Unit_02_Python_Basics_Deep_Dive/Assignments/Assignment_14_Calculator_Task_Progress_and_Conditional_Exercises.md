## Unit 2, Assignment 14 - Calculator Task Progress and Conditional Exercises
Due: Friday, November 7th 2025

### Calculator Task Progress

1. Continue working on your calculator task.  Consider using this as an opportunity to revisit the empathize, define, and ideate stages of the design thinking process to ensure that calculator your program is aligned to the needs of your audience.
2. Save your file.
3. Capture a screencast **(in .mp4 format)** of your code in action.
4. Save your video as `LastNameFirstInitial_Calculator_Task_Video.mp4`
5. Upload your code and video files to your Calculator Task folder.
6. Commit your progress.
    * Remember to write a short and simple commit message to describe your progress.
    * Remember to write a more detailed commit description to describe your progress and next steps.

7. If you updated your design planner, remember to scan **all** pages, save the file as `LastNameFirstIntial_Calculator_Task_Design_Planner.pdf`, upload it to your Calculator Task folder, and commit.
  
*Feel free to continue working on your calculator!*

**Whenever you make significant progress (or if you haven't commited in a while) remember to save your code, capture a screencast, upload, and commit!**

### Conditional Exercises

In your notes, complete the following exercises.  Wherever  code trace each of the code snippets below to determine what the code will output.  If executing the code will result in an error, explain why:

1.  Arrange the code boxes below in the correct positions to form a conditional instruction which gaurantees that a certain statement is executed when the `price` variable is greater than `100`.<br><br>
`>` `:`  `100`  `price`  `if`

2.  Arrange the code boxes below in the correct positions to form a conditional instruction which gaurantees that a certain statement is executed when the `team_1_score` and `team_2_score` variables are equal to each other.<br><br>
`:` `team_1_score`  `if`  `team_2_score`  `==`

3.  Arrange the code boxes below in the correct positions to form a conditional instruction which gaurantees that a certain statement is executed when the `location` variable is not equal to `'New York'`.<br><br>
`=` `!`  `'New York'`  `if`  `:`   `location`


4.  Arrange the code boxes below in the correct positions to form a conditional instruction which gaurantees that a certain statement is executed when the `age` variable is greater than or equal to `16`.<br><br>
`<` `if`  `age`  `:`  `15`   `=`

5. What is the expected output of the following code.  If running the code will result in an error, explain why.  **Show all work and code tracing**

```python
result = 1 + 5 // 2 * 2
if result == 6:
  print('$')
elif result >= 5:
  print('$$')
else:
  print('$$$')
```

Scan your work, save it as `LastNameFirstInitial_Conditional_Exercises.pdf`, and upload it to your assignments folder.<br>

Commit your progress.  Remember to write an appropriate commit message.  For example, *"Completed conditional exercises."*
