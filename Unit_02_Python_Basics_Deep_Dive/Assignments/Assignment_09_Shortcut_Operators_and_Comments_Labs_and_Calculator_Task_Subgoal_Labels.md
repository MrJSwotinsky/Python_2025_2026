## Unit 2, Assignment 9 - Shortcut Operators and Comments Labs and Calculator Task Subgoal Labels
Due: Friday, October 24th 2025

### Shortcut Operators and Comments Labs
1. Navigate to https://www.edube.org, sign in, access Python Essentials 1, and read **Python Essentials 1 Module 2, 2.4.1.7  - 2.5.1.3**
2. Complete lab 2.4.1.7 and upload it to your assignments folder / filename: `LastNameFirstInitial_Lab_2_4_1_7_Variables.py`
3. Complete lab 2.4.1.9 and upload it to your assignments folder / filename: `LastNameFirstInitial_Lab_2_4_1_9_Variables:_A_Simple_Converter.py`
4. Complete lab 2.4.1.10 and upload it to your assignments folder / filename: `LastNameFirstInitial_Lab_2_4_1_10_Operators_and_Expressions.py`
5. Complete lab 2.5.1.2 and upload it to your assignments folder / filename: `LastNameFirstInitial_Lab_2_5_1_2_Comments.py`      

*For each lab, remember to write an appropriate commit message.*

### Calculator Task Subgoal Labels:
1. Update your code by adding subgoal labels in the form of comments to outline your plan for this task.
2. Continue developing your welcome screen.  Remember to apply what you have learned about the `print()` function, including escape characters, the `sep` parameter, the `end` parameter, and ASCII art as you work to create a visually appealing welcome screen that greets the user.  **Remember to keep your audience in mind.**
3. Save your file.
4. Capture a screencast **(in .mp4 format)** of your code in action.

    At this stage, this should be a **very short (i.e. a couple of senconds long)** video of the console displaying the welcome screen.

   *Note: The subgoal labels should not appear in the console because they are comments.*

5. Save your video as `LastNameFirstInitial_Calculator_Task_Video.mp4`
6. Upload your code and video files to your Calculator Task folder.
7. Commit your progress.
    * Remember to write a short and simple commit message to describe your progress.
    * Remember to write a more detailed commit description to describe your progress and next steps.
  
*Feel free to continue working on your calculator!*

**Whenever you make significant progress (or if you haven't commited in a while) remember to save your code, capture a screencast, upload, and commit!**
