### Calculator Task Define Stage
1. Complete the **Define** column of your [design planner](hhttps://github.com/MrJSwotinsky/Python_2025_2026/blob/main/Resources/Design%20Planner.pdf) to capture your engagement in the Define stage of the [design thinking](https://github.com/MrJSwotinsky/Python_2025_2026/blob/main/Resources/Design%20Thinking.pdf) process.<br>
   <table>
      <tr>
         <td>
            <b>CAUTION:</b> Before moving on to the next step, be sure you have uploaded <a href = https://github.com/MrJSwotinsky/Python_2025_2026/blob/main/Unit_02_Python_Basics_Deep_Dive/Assignments/Assignment_01_Calculator_Task_Empathize_Stage.md>Assignment 01</a> to Github.<br>
         </td>
      </tr>
   </table>

2. Scan your design planner and save it as `LastNameFirstInitial_Calculator_Task_Design_Planner.png`.<br>
   <table>
      <tr>
         <td>
            <b>NOTE:</b> Keep the same filename.  This will overwrite the original file on your device.  However, as long as you have uploaded Assignment 01 to GitHub it will be stored in version history.
         </td>
      </tr>
   </table>

3. Upload your design planner to your Calculator Task folder.
4. Commit your progress.  Remember to write an appropriate commit message.  For example, *'Completed define column.'*

**As you work forward on this task, keep in mind you may need to go back to revisit the define stage.**
