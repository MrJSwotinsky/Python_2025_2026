## Unit 2, Assignment 6 - Operators
Due: Wednesday, October 15th 2025

### Operators Review

1. Navigate to https://www.edube.org, sign in, access Python Essentials 1, and read **Python Essentials 1 Module 2, 2.3.1.1  - 2.3.1.6** 
2. Create a file in your Assignments folder titled, `LastNameFirstInitial_Operators.md`.
3. Copy/paste the code at the bottom of this assignment.
4. Respond to all prompts.  As you work, use the IDLE or edube sandbox to check your work.
5. Commit your progress.  Remember to write an appropriate commit message.  For example, *"Completed operators review."*

# Operators Prompts

## 1) Identify the two unary operators in Python.  Why are the referred to as 'unary'? What do they accomplish?

## 2) Identify seven binary operators in Python.  Why are the referred to as 'binary'? What do they accomplish?

## 3) Describe the results (including data type) when Python combines two ints using the `+`, `-`, `*`, `**`, and `//` operators.  Provide a few examples of each.

## 4) Describe the result (including data type) when Python combines two ints using the `/` operator.  Consider examples in which one int **is** divisible by the other (e.g. `4/2`) as well as examples in which one int is **not** divisible by the other (e.g. `5/2`).  Provide a few examples of each.

## 5) Describe the result (including data type) when Python combines two ints using the `%` operator.

## 6) Describe the results (including data type) when Python combines two floats using the `+`, `-`, `*`, `**`, and `/` operators.  Provide a few examples of each.

## 7) Describe the result (including data type) when Python combines two floats using the `//` operator.  Consider examples in which one float **is** divisible by the other (e.g. `5.0//2.5`) as well as examples in which one int is **not** divisible by the other (e.g. `3.2//1.5`).  Provide a few examples of each.

## 8) Describe the result (including data type) when Python combines two floats using the `%` operator.  Explain what happens if either float is not equivalent to int (e.g. `2.5`).  Provide a few examples of each.

## 9) Describe the result (including data type) when Python combines an int and a float using the `+`, `-`, `*`, `**`, and `/` operators.  Provide a few examples of each.

## 10) Describe the result (including data type) when Python combines an int and a float using the `//` operator.  Consider examples in which one **is** divisible by the other (e.g. `6//1.5`) as well as examples in which one int is **not** divisible by the other (e.g. `4.0//3`).  Provide a few examples of each.

## 11) Describe the result (including data type) when Python combines an int and a float using the `%` operator.  Explain what happens if the float is not equivalent to int (e.g. `3.5`).  Provide a few examples of each.

## 12) Describe the result (including data type) when Python combines two strings using the `+` operator.  Consider examples in which the strings contain non-numeric characters as well as examples in which the strings contain only numeric characters.  Provide a few examples of each.

## 13) Describe the result (including data type) when Python combines two strings using the `-`, `*`, `**`, `/`, `//`, and `%` operators.  Provide a few examples of each.

## 14) Describe the result (including data type) when Python combines a string and a numeric data type using the `*` operator.  Consider examples in which the numeric data type is a int as well as examples in which the numeric data type is a float.  Additionally consider examples of the form `number * string` as well as examples of the form `string * number`.  Provide a few examples of each.

## 15) Describe the result (including data type) when Python combines a string and a numeric data type using the `+`, `-`, `**`, `/`, `//`, and `%` operators.  Provide a few examples of each.

## 16) Describe the result (including data type) when Python combines a boolean and a numeric data type using the `+`, `-`, `*`, `**`, `/`, `//`, and `%` operators.  Consider examples in which the numeric data type is an int as well as examples in which the numeric data type is a float.  Provide a few examples of each.

## 17) Describe the result (including data type) when Python combines two booleans using the `+`, `-`, `*`, `**`, `/`, `//`, and `%` operators.  Provide a few examples of each.

## 18) Describe the result (including data type) when Python tries to divide, integer divide, or mod by `False`.  What happens and why?
