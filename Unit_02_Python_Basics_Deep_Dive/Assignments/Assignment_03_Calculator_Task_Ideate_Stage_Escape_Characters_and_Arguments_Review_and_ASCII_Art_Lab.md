## Unit 2, Assignment 3 - Calculator Task Ideate Stage, Escape Characters and Arguments Review, and ASCII Art Lab
Due: Wednesday, October 8th 2025

### Calculator Task Define Stage
1. Complete the **Ideate** column of your [design planner](https://github.com/MrJSwotinsky/Python_2025_2026/blob/main/Resources/Design%20Planner.pdf) to capture your engagement in the Define stage of the [design thinking](https://github.com/MrJSwotinsky/Python_2025_2026/blob/main/Resources/Design%20Thinking.pdf) process.<br>
2. Scan your design planner and save it as `LastNameFirstInitial_Calculator_Task_Design_Planner.png`.
3. Upload your design planner to your Calculator Task folder.
4. Commit your progress.  Remember to write an appropriate commit message.  For example, *'Completed ideate column.'*

**As you work forward on this task, keep in mind you may need to go back to revisit the ideate stage.**

### Escape Characters and Arguments Review

1. Navigate to https://www.edube.org, sign in, access Python Essentials 1, and read **Python Essentials 1 Module 2, 2.1.1.10  - 2.1.1.20** 
2. Create a file in your Assignments folder titled, `LastNameFirstInitial_Escape_Characters_and_Arguments_Review.md`.
3. Copy/paste the code at the bottom of this assignment.
4. Respond to all prompts.
5. Commit your progress.  Remember to write an appropriate commit message.  For example, *"Completed escape characters and arguments review."*

## 6) In the `print()` function, which arguments are passed using the positional technique?

## 7) In the `print()` function, which arguments are passed using the keyword technique?

## 8) When the `print()` function recieves several objects as positional arguments, how does it respond?

## 9) Explain what the `sep` parameter accomplishes.

## 10) Explain what the `end` parameter accomplishes.
```

### ASCII Art Lab

1. Use the Python IDLE to complete the lab below.  Save your file as `LastNameFirstInitial_ASCII_Art_Lab.py`
   
Write a program that leverages escape characters, as well as the `sep` and `end` parameters to display the following:

* Display the image below using **3 lines** of code:
```
I <3 Love <3 Python <3
```

* Display the image below using a **single line** of code:
```
|---|---|---|
|---|---|---|
|---|---|---|   
```

* Display the image below using as **5 lines** of code:
```
 \\\\\\
 / ' ' \
|   "   |
| \___/ |
 \_____/
```

* Display the image below using as a **single line** of code:
```
 \\\\\\
 / ' ' \
|   "   |
| \___/ |
 \_____/
```
   
2. Upload your ASCII Art lab to your Labs folder.
