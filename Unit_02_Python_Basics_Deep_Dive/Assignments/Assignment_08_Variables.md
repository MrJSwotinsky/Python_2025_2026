## 5) Explain what happens when a new value is assigned to a variable that already has a value assigned to it?

## 6) Describe all requirements for a variable name to be legal in Python.

## 7) Provide several examples of legal variable names.

## 8) Provide several examples of variable names that are not legal.  Explain why each is not legal.

## 9) Most often, what specific exception will be raised if you try to define a variable using a variable name that is not legal?

## 10) What are some examples of variable names that are legal but not recommended by the PEP 8 - Style Guide for Python Code.  Explain why each is not recommended.

## 11) What will happen if you try to define a variable using a variable name that is legal but not recommended by the PEP 8 - Style Guide for Python Code?

## 12)  The first code snippet below will generate an error, but the second code snippet below will not.  Explain why.
