<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>DO NOW:</b><br><br>
    You have just started a new job, and you have been assigned a project to collaboratively work on with a new colleague.  However, you and your new colleague speak different languages, and neither of you know or understand the language each other speak.  What are some strategies you can apply to communicate with each other?  Come up with as many strategies as you can think of <i>(Be creative, and think outside the box.  There are no wrong answers!)</i><br><br>
    <b>Be prepared to share your responses</b></td>
