## Unit 0, Assignment 3 - Machine Language
Due: Thursday, September 11th 2025

### Represent your birthDAY like a computer:

1. In a new section of your notes, sketch the image below. This image represents one byte.  Each individual square represents one bit.

    <img src = https://github.com/MrJSwotinsky/Python_2025_2026/blob/main/Resources/one_byte.png>

2. Next to the byte, write down the of **DAY** part of your birthday.  For example, if your birthday is September 10th, write down the number 10.

3. Shade the appropriate number of squares to show how a computer would **physically** represent the **DAY** part of your birthday.  **SHOW ALL WORK**

4. Capture an image of your work including your shaded byte, birthDAY, and your work and save it using the filename: `LastNameFirstInitial_birthDAY.png`

### Represent your initials like a computer:

1. In a new section of your notes, sketch the image below. This image represents two bytes.  Each individual square represents one bit.

    <img src = https://github.com/MrJSwotinsky/Python_2025_2026/blob/main/Resources/two_bytes.png>

2. Next to the first byte write down the first initial of your first name.  Next to the second byte write down the first initial of your last name.
   
3. Shade the appropriate number of squares to show how a computer would **physically** represent your initials.  **SHOW ALL WORK**

4. Capture an image of your work including your shaded bytes, initials, and your work and save it using the filename: `LastNameFirstInitial_Initials.png`

### Represent your favorite color like a computer:

1. Navigate to the [Google Color Picker](https://www.google.com/search?q=google+color+picker) and adjust select your favorite color.

2. Capture an image of your favorite color including the RGB, CMYK, HSV, and HSL values (as shown below) and save it using the filename: `LastNameFirstInitial_Color_Picker.png`

    <img src = https://github.com/MrJSwotinsky/Python_2025_2026/blob/main/Resources/Google_Color_Picker_Sample.png>

3. In a new section of your notes, sketch the image below. This image represents three bytes.  Each individual square represents one bit.

    <img src = https://github.com/MrJSwotinsky/Python_2025_2026/blob/main/Resources/three_bytes.png>

4. Next to the first byte write down the red value of your favorite color.  Next to the second byte write down the green value of your favorite color.  Next to the third byte, write down the blue value of your favorite color.
   
5. Shade the appropriate number of squares to show how a computer would **physically** represent your favorite color.  **SHOW ALL WORK**

6. Capture an image of your work including your shaded bytes, red, green, blue values, and your work and save it using the filename: `LastNameFirstInitial_Favorite_Color.png`


### Share your work:

1. [Create a folder](https://github.com/MrJSwotinsky/AP_Computer_Science_Principles_2025_2026/blob/main/Resources/Create_GitHub_Folder_Guide.md) in your Python Portfolio repo titled, `LastNameFirstInitial_Assignments`.

2. Upload your `LastNameFirstInitial_birthDAY.png`, `LastNameFirstInitial_Initials.png`, `LastNameFirstInitial_Favorite_Color.png`, and `LastNameFirstInitial_Color_Picker.png` files to your Assignments folder.

3. Commit your progress.  Remember to write an appropriate commit message.  For example, *"Uploaded machine language images."*

4. [Create a file](https://github.com/MrJSwotinsky/AP_Computer_Science_Principles_2025_2026/blob/main/Resources/Create_GitHub_Folder_Guide.md) in your Assignments folder titled, `LastNameFirstInitial_Machine_Language.md`.

5. Copy/paste the code at the bottom of this assignment.

6. Copy paste the URL for your birthDAY image after the equal sign in the first <img src = > HTML tag.

7. Copy paste the URL for your initials image after the equal sign in the second <img src = > HTML tag.

8. Copy paste the URL for your favorite color image after the equal sign in the third <img src = > HTML tag.

9. Copy paste the URL for your color picker image after the equal sign in the third <img src = > HTML tag.

10. Commit your progress.  Remember to write an appropriate commit message.  For example, *"Completed machine language assignment."*
