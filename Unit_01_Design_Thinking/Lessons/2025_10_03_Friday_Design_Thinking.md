      <ul>
        <li>Who were you building a roller coaster for? What were their needs, feelings, and challenges?</li>
        <li>How did you define the problem you were trying to tackle?</li>
        <li>During brainstorming, what were some of the ideas you came up with?  Which ideas did you keep, and why? Which ideas did you throw out, and why?</li>
        <li>What successes did you experience?</li>
        <li>What challenges did you encounter and how did you resolve them?</li>
        <li>Overall, how was the experience of competing in the roller coaster design challenge?</li>
